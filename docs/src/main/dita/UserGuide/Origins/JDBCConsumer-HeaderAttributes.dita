 <title>JDBC Record Header Attributes </title>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>JDBC Query Consumer origin<indexterm>JDBC record header
                attributes</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>JDBC record header
                    attributes<indexterm>JDBC Query Consumer</indexterm></indexterm>The JDBC Query
            Consumer generates JDBC record header attributes that provide additional information
            about each record, such as the original data type of a field or the source tables for
            the record. The origin receives these details from the JDBC driver. </p>

            />
            
        <p>JDBC header attributes include a user-defined prefix to differentiate the JDBC header
            attributes from other record header attributes. By default, the prefix is "jdbc". You
            can change the prefix that the origin uses and you can configure the origin not to
            create JDBC header attributes.</p>
