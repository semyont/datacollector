 <title>Working with a MySQL JDBC Driver</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Note the following issues that can occur when using a MySQL JDBC driver with the JDBC
            Multitable Consumer origin:<dl>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>The driver returns time values to the second.</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>Due to a MySQL JDBC driver issue, the driver cannot return time values to
                            the millisecond. Instead, the driver returns the values to the second.
                            For example, if a column has a value of 20:12:50.581, the driver reads
                            the value as 20:12:50.000.</p>
                    </dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>The origin might not read new rows created in MySQL while the pipeline is
                        running.</dt>
                    <dd>When using the default transaction isolation level, the origin might not
                        read new rows that are created in MySQL as the pipeline is running. To
                        resolve this issue, configure the origin to use the read committed
                        transaction isolation level in the Advanced tab.</dd>
                </dlentry>
            </dl></p>
