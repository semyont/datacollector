        <dl>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>None</dt>
                <dd>Reads the tables in the order that they are listed in the database.</dd>
            </dlentry>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>Alphabetical</dt>
                <dd>Reads the tables in alphabetical order.</dd>
            </dlentry>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>Referential Constraints</dt>
                <dd>Reads the tables based on the dependencies between the tables. The origin reads
                    the parent table first, and then reads the child tables that refer to the parent
                    table with a foreign key.</dd>
                <dd>You cannot use the referential constraints order when the tables to be read have
                    a cyclic dependency. When the origin detects a cyclic dependency, the pipeline
                    fails to validate with the following
                    error:<codeblock>JDBC_68 Tables referring to each other in a cyclic fashion.</codeblock></dd>
                <dd>Note that the referential constraints order can cause pipeline validation or
                    initialization to slow down because the origin has to sort the tables before
                    reading them.</dd>
