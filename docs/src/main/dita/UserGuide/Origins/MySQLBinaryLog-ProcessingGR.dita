 <title>Processing Generated Records</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>MySQL Binary Log origin<indexterm>processing generated
                records</indexterm></indexterm>Due to the structure of the MySQL binary log records,
            you might want to use processors to restructure the record and remove any unnecessary
            fields. </p>
        <p>For example, the records include CDC data in record fields. If all you need is record
            data, you can use a Field Remover to remove the unwanted fields. </p>
        <p>Similarly, update records include the previous data in an OldData map field, and the
            updated data in a Data map field. If all you need is the updated data, you can use the
            Field Remover to drop the OldData field from the record. And you could use a Field
            Flattener processor to flatten the fields in the Data field.</p>
