 <title>Generated Records</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>MongoDB Oplog origin<indexterm>generated records</indexterm></indexterm>The MongoDB
            Oplog origin generates records based on data from the MongoDB Oplog and adds CRUD and
            CDC related record header attributes.</p>
        <p>The structure of Oplog records is unique, so when necessary, you might use some
            processors in the pipeline to convert record structure. </p>
        <p>For example, for insert records, record data resides in a map field named "o". But for an
            update record, the _id field is part of the o2 map field. To merge the record data, you
            can use a Field Flattener to flatten the map fields and a Field Remover to remove any
            unnecessary fields. </p>
        <p>For more information about the Oplog record structure, see the MongoDB documentation. The
            following site is also a good resource: <xref
