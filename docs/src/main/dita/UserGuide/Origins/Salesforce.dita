            Salesforce origin, you define connection information that the origin uses to connect to
            Salesforce, including the API type that the origin uses to connect to Salesforce. By
            default, the origin uses Salesforce API version 36.0. You can change the API version if
            needed.</p>
        <p>You can configure the origin to read data in one or both of the following ways: </p>
        <ul id="ul_kr4_1np_tx">
            <li>Execute a query to read existing data from Salesforce. </li>
            <li>Subscribe to the Force.com Streaming API to receive notifications for changes to
                Salesforce data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When processing existing data, you can configure the origin to query Salesforce at
            regular intervals. You cannot use repeating queries when subscribed to notifications.
            When repeating a query, the origin can perform a full or incremental read. </p>
        <p>The origin creates Salesforce header attributes to provide information about the source
            data in record headers. The origin also <ph
