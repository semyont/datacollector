 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>JDBC Query Consumer origin<indexterm>Microsoft SQL Server CDC header
                    attribute</indexterm></indexterm>When reading change capture data from Microsoft
            SQL Server, the JDBC Query Consumer origin includes the CRUD operation type in the
            sdc.operation.type record header attribute. </p>
        <p conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/CDC-UseCDCdest"/>
        <p>The origin uses the following values in the sdc.operation.type record header attribute to
            represent the operation type: <ul id="ul_dkt_g5l_dy">
                <li>1 for INSERT</li>
                <li>2 for DELETE</li>
                <li>3 for UPDATE</li>
                <li>5 for unsupported codes</li>
            </ul></p>
