                    Server</indexterm></indexterm>The HTTP Server origin is a multithreaded origin
            that listens on an HTTP endpoint and processes the contents of all authorized HTTP POST
            requests. Use the HTTP Server origin to read high volumes of HTTP POST requests using
            multiple threads. </p>
        <p>The HTTP Server origin can use multiple threads to enable parallel processing of data
            from multiple HTTP clients. Before you configure the origin, perform additional steps to
            configure the HTTP clients. </p>
        <p>When you configure the HTTP Server origin, you specify the maximum number of concurrent
            requests to determine how many threads to use. You also define the listening port,
            application ID, and the maximum message size. You can optionally enable HTTPS. </p>
