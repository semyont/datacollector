 <title>File Name Pattern and Mode</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>Directory origin<indexterm>file name pattern and
                mode</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>file name pattern and
                    mode<indexterm>Directory origin</indexterm></indexterm>Use a file name pattern
            to define the files to process. You can use either a glob pattern or a regular
            expression to define the file name pattern. </p>
        <p>The origin processes files based on the file name pattern mode, file name pattern, and
            specified directory. For example, if you specify a <codeph>/logs/weblog/
            </codeph>directory, glob mode, and <codeph>*.json</codeph> as the file name pattern, the
            Directory origin processes all files with the "json" extension in the
                <codeph>/logs/weblog/</codeph> directory. </p>
        <p>The origin processes files in order based on the specified read order.</p>
