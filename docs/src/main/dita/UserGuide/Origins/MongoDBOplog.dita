                    Oplog</indexterm></indexterm>The MongoDB Oplog origin reads entries from MongoDB
            Oplog.</p>
        <p>MongoDB stores information about changes to the database in a local capped collection
            called an Oplog. The Oplog contains information about changes in data as well as changes
            in the database. The MongoDB Oplog origin can read any operation written to the
            Oplog.</p>
        <p>Use the MongoDB Oplog origin to capture changes in data or the database. To process
            MongoDB data written to a standard capped or uncapped collection, use the <xref
                href="MongoDB.dita#concept_bk4_2rs_ns">MongoDB origin</xref>.</p>
        <p>The MongoDB Oplog origin <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/ph-CDCoverview"
            /></p>
        <p>When you configure the MongoDB Oplog origin, you configure connection information, an
            optional timestamp and ordinal to specify where to start the read, the operations that
            you want to process, and the read preference.</p>
        <p>You can optionally configure advanced options that determine how the origin connects to
            MongoDB, including enabling SSL/TLS. </p>
