 <title>Oplog Timestamp and Ordinal</title>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>MongoDB Oplog origin<indexterm>timestamp and
            ordinal</indexterm></indexterm>When you start the pipeline, the MongoDB Oplog origin
            starts reading from the beginning of the Oplog by default. You can configure a timestamp
            and ordinal to specify where you want to start the processing. </p>
        <p>MongoDB Oplog entries include a timestamp field named "ts" that consists of a timestamp
            and ordinal as
            follows:<codeblock>"ts": Timestamp(&lt;timestamp>, &lt;ordinal>)</codeblock></p>
        <p>The timestamp format is the seconds since the Unix epoch, such as 1412180887. </p>
        <p>The ordinal is an integer counter used to differentiate between entries that occur in the
            same second. </p>
        <p>You can use a timestamp and ordinal to specify where to begin reading from the Oplog.
            When you use a timestamp, you must also define an ordinal. </p>
        <p>For more information about the Oplog timestamp field, see the MongoDB documentation.</p>
