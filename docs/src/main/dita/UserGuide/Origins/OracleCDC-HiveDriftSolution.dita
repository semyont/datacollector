            recommendation</indexterm></indexterm>If you use the Oracle CDC Client origin as part of
            a Drift Synchronization Solution for Hive pipeline, make sure to pass only records
            flagged for Insert to the Hive Metadata processor. </p>
        <p>The Drift Synchronization Solution for Hive enables automatic updates of Hive tables
            based on incoming data. The Hive Metadata processor, the first stage in the solution,
            expects Insert records only. Below are some recommended methods to ensure that the
            processor receives only Insert records:<ul id="ul_y5h_4xj_fx">
                <li>Configure the Oracle CDC Client to process only Insert records. </li>
                <li>If you want to process additional record types in the pipeline, use a Stream
                    Selector to route only Insert records to the Hive Metadata processor. </li>
            </ul></p>
