        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> generates
      a record for every MongoDB document. To read change data capture information from the MongoDB
      Oplog, use the <xref href="#concept_bk4_2rs_ns" format="dita">MongoDB Oplog</xref> origin. </p>
  <p>The MongoDB origin reads from capped and uncapped collections. When you configure MongoDB, you
      define connection information, such as the connection string and MongoDB credentials. You also
      configure the offset field, collection type, and initial offset. These properties determine
      how the origin queries the database. </p>
    <p>You can optionally configure advanced options that determine how the origin connects to
      MongoDB, including enabling SSL/TLS for the origin.</p>
