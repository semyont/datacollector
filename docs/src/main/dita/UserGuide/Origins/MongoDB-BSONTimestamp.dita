 <title>BSON Timestamp</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>MongoDB origin<indexterm>BSON timestamp
                support</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>BSON timestamp<indexterm>support in
                    MongoDB origin</indexterm></indexterm>When processing data from MongoDB version
            2.6 and later, the MongoDB origin supports the MongoDB BSON Timestamp data type. </p>
        <p>The MongoDB BSON Timestamp is a MongoDB data type that includes a timestamp and ordinal
            as
            follows:<codeblock>&lt;BSON Timestamp field name>:Timestamp(&lt;timestamp>, &lt;ordinal>)</codeblock></p>
        <p>The MongoDB origin converts the BSON Timestamp to a map as
            follows:<codeblock>&lt;BSON Timestamp field name>{MAP}:
    Timestamp{DATETIME}:&lt;UTC timestamp>
    Ordinal{INTEGER}:&lt;integer ordinal></codeblock></p>
        <p>For example, a Transaction BSON timestamp of <codeph>(1485449409, 1)</codeph>, is
            converted to the following Transaction map field:</p>
        <p>
            <codeblock>"Transaction":{
    "Timestamp":Jan 26, 2016 14:50:09PM
    "Ordinal":1
}</codeblock>
        </p>
