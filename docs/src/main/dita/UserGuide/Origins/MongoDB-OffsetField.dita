 <title>Offset Field and Initial Offset</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>MongoDB origin<indexterm>offset field</indexterm></indexterm>MongoDB uses the offset
            field to track the data to read. By default, the MongoDB origin uses the _id field as
            the offset field. </p>
        <p>You can use a nested offset field, such as o._id. Or, you can use any Object ID field or
            string field as the offset field. The results for using any field besides the default
            _id field are not guaranteed.</p>
        <p>When you use an Object ID field, specify a timestamp to use as the initial offset. Object
            ID fields include an embedded timestamp, and the origin uses that timestamp to determine
            where in the collection to begin reading. When you define the initial offset for an
            Object ID field, use the following format:<codeblock>YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss</codeblock></p>
        <p>When you use a string field, specify the initial string to use as the initial offset. </p>
