 <title>Data Formats</title>
 <shortdesc>The HTTP Client origin processes data differently based on the data format. The origin
        processes the following types of data: </shortdesc>
 <conbody>

                    <dt>JSON</dt>

                    <dd>When an object exceeds the specified maximum object length, the origin
                        processes the object based on the error handling configured for the stage. </dd>

                    <dd>When a line exceeds the specified maximum line length, the origin truncates
                        the line. The origin adds a boolean field named Truncated to indicate if the
