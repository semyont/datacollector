        <p><indexterm>Salesforce origin<indexterm>CRUD operation header
                attribute</indexterm></indexterm>When the Salesforce origin subscribes to
            notifications and reads changed data from a PushTopic, the origin includes the CRUD
            operation type for a record in the sdc.operation.type header attribute.</p>
        <p conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/CDC-UseCDCdest"/>
        <p>The Salesforce origin uses the following values in the sdc.operation.type record header
            attribute to represent the operation type: <ul id="ul_dkt_g5l_dy">
                <li>1 for INSERT</li>
                <li>2 for DELETE</li>
                <li>3 for UPDATE</li>
                <li>5 for unsupported operations, such as UNDELETED</li>
            </ul><note type="tip">Records that are undeleted contain only the record ID. If you need
                the record data, you can use the Salesforce Lookup to retrieve it. </note></p>
