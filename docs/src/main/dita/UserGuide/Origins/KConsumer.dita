 <title>Kafka Consumer</title>
 <shortdesc>The Kafka Consumer origin reads data from an Apache Kafka cluster.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>Kafka Consumer
          origin<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>origins<indexterm>Kafka
          Consumer</indexterm></indexterm>When you configure a Kafka Consumer, you configure the
      consumer group name, topic, and ZooKeeper connection information. </p>
    <p>When using Kafka version 0.8.2 or later to consume messages in the Avro format, you can
      configure the Kafka Consumer to work with the Confluent Schema Registry. The Confluent Schema
      Registry is a distributed storage layer for Avro schemas which uses Kafka as its underlying
      storage mechanism.</p>
    <p>You can add additional Kafka configuration properties as needed. When using <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/KafkaSecure"/>, you can
      also configure the origin to use Kafka security features.</p>
    <p>Kafka Consumer includes record header attributes that enable you to use the origins of a
      record in pipeline processing. </p>
