 <title>Flatten Records</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>At this time, the Drift Synchronization Solution does not process records with nested fields.
            If necessary, you can use the Field Flattener processor to flatten records with nested
            fields before passing them to the Hive Metadata processor. </p>
