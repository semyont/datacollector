 <title>Measure Dataflow Quality</title>
 <shortdesc><ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
        provides the same level of detailed monitoring for topologies and jobs that you are
        accustomed to seeing for pipelines within <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>. </shortdesc>

        <p><draft-comment author="alisontaylor">text copied from same topic in DPM User Guide. Make
                the same updates in both places. </draft-comment>As a data architect or as a DevOps
            or site reliability engineer, you can measure the health of the topology and the
            performance of all jobs and connecting systems included in the topology. <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
            monitoring provides real-time statistics and error information about the running
            pipelines. </p>
        <p>For example, the Summary tab of the Customer 360 topology provides a single view into the
            record count and throughput for all running pipelines in the topology:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/DPM_MeasureQualityTopology.png" scale="55" id="image_hv1_ctq_fx"
            /></p>
        <p>You can select a job or a connecting system within the topology to discover more detailed
            monitoring about the job or system. </p>
        <p>When you start a job on a group of <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s,
                <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
            provides a single view of the statistics for the complete job. From a job, you can view
            the statistics for a single pipeline or you can view the aggregated statistics across
            all remote pipeline instances that are run on a group of <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
            />s.</p>
        <p>For example, if we select the Social Feeds Dataflows job in the topology, the Summary tab
            displays metrics for the selected job:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/DPM_MeasureQualityJob.png" scale="55" id="image_ylz_ptq_fx"
            /></p>
