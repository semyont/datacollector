 <title>Viewing Pipeline Types in Data Collector</title>
 <conbody>
        <p>Let's look at a sample <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            Home page to see how <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            displays local pipelines, published pipelines, and DPM controlled pipelines:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/DPM_LocalDPMControlledPipelines.png" scale="50"
                id="image_rtj_fvs_gx"/></p>
        <p>The <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            displays the following pipelines:</p>
        <ul id="ul_oh2_shm_2w">
            <li>Local pipeline that was developed in this <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                /> and can be run locally on this <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                />. Local pipelines are listed by name. In the image above, Remove Extra Fields is a
                local pipeline that is not running. The Remove Extra Fields pipeline has not been
                published to <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"
                />, as indicated by no version number after its name.</li>
            <li>Published pipeline that was published to <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
                and can still be run locally on this <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                />. Published pipelines are listed by name and version number. In the image above,
                Kafka to HDFS is a published pipeline that is not running.</li>
            <li>Running published pipeline that was published to <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"
                />, then run from a job. Published pipelines that are remotely run from jobs are
                named as follows:<codeblock>&lt;pipeline name>:&lt;job ID></codeblock></li>
            <li>Running system pipeline that collects, aggregates, and pushes metrics for all of the
                remote pipeline instances run from the job. Running system pipelines are named as
                follows:<codeblock>System Pipeline for Job &lt;job name>:&lt;system job ID></codeblock></li>
        </ul>
        <note type="tip">In the image above, the job was started on a <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            used to design pipelines. As a best practice, use labels within <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/> to
            separate development <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s
            from production <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s.
            That way, you can ensure that published pipelines are only run on production <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s
            and not on a <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            that a developer is currently using to design pipelines. For more information about
            using labels, see the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
