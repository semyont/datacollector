 <title>Best Practices for SDC RPC</title>

                    statistics for DPM</indexterm></indexterm>Consider the following best practices
            when you configure a pipeline to write aggregated statistics to an SDC RPC destination:
                <ul id="ul_irc_szr_yy">
                <li>To avoid mixing statistics from different jobs, use a unique SDC RPC ID for each
                    job. </li>
                <li>Monitor the disk space where the Dev SDC RPC with Buffering origin in the system
                    pipeline temporarily buffers the records to disk before passing the records to
                    the next stage in the pipeline.<p>The Dev SDC RPC with Buffering origin in the
                        system pipeline temporarily buffers the statistics to a queue on disk. If
                        the system pipeline slows, the temporary location on disk might become full.
                        The temporary statistics are written to the location specified in the
                            <codeph>java.io.tmpdir</codeph> system property, to a file with the
                        following
                    name:</p><codeblock>sdc-fragments&lt;file ID>.queueFile</codeblock></li>
            </ul></p>
