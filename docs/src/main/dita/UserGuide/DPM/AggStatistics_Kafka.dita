 <title>Write Statistics to Kafka</title>
 <shortdesc>When you write statistics to a Kafka cluster, <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
        effectively adds a Kafka Producer destination to the pipeline that you are configuring. The
        system pipeline reads the statistics from Kafka, and then aggregates and sends the
        statistics to <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>. </shortdesc>

                    statistics</indexterm></indexterm>When you write aggregated statistics to a
            Kafka cluster, you define connection information and the topic to write to. </p>
        <p>You also configure the partition strategy. The pipeline passes data to partitions in the
            Kafka topic based on the partition strategy that you choose. You can add additional
            Kafka configuration properties as needed. </p>
        <note>At this time, you cannot configure the pipeline to connect securely through SSL/TLS or
            Kerberos when using Kafka.</note>
