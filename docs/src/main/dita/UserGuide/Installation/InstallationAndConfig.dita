 <title>Installation</title>
 <shortdesc>You can install <ph
      conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> and start it
    manually or run it as a service. </shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>You can install a full version of <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> that
      includes all stage libraries. Or, you can install a core version of <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> to install
      only the stage libraries that you want to use. The core installation allows <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> to use
      less disk space.</p>
    <p>If you use Docker, you can also run the <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> image from
      Docker Hub. </p>
    <p>If you use Cloudera Manager, you can install and administer <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> through
      Cloudera Manager. </p>
