 <title>Pipeline Configuration</title>
 <shortdesc>Configure a pipeline on the pipeline canvas by adding and linking the stages that you
  want to use. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>When you configure a pipeline, you add a single <term>origin</term> stage to represent source
   data, <term>processor</term> stages to perform processing and routing, and one or more
    <term>destination</term> stages to represent target data. Link the stages to create the flow of
   data from origin to destinations. </p>
  <p>To add stages to the canvas, you can use the stage library and connect stages manually, or you
   can use the Pipeline Creation Help Bar to automatically link a new stage to the pipeline.</p>
  <p>The pipeline canvas automatically saves and validates your work, and provides warnings for
   parts of the pipeline that are not yet complete or valid. You can view a full list of issues to
   help you configure the pipeline. You can also perform a data preview to view how the pipeline
   transforms data.</p>
  <p>To define pipeline properties, such as the delivery guarantee, constants or error handling,
   click in any unused space of the canvas. To define the properties for a stage, select the
   stage. You can configure metric or data alerts on the Rules tab of the pipeline properties panel.
