 <title>Earlier Implementations</title>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>CRUD header attribute<indexterm>earlier
                implementations</indexterm></indexterm>Some origins were enabled for CDC using
            different record header attributes in earlier releases, but they all now include the
            sdc.operation.type record header attribute. All earlier CRUD header attributes are
            retained for backward compatibility. </p>
        <p>Similarly, CRUD-enabled destinations that were enabled to look for the CRUD operation
            type in other header attributes can now look for the sdc.operation.type record header
            attribute first and check the alternate attribute afterwards. The alternate header
            attribute functionality is retained for backward compatibility.</p>
