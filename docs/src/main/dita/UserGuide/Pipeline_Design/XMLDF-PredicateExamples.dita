 <title>Predicate Examples</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>predicate<indexterm>examples</indexterm></indexterm>To process all data in a
                <codeph>collections</codeph> element under the <codeph>apps</codeph> second-level
            element, you would use the following simplified XPath
            expression:<codeblock>/*/apps/collections</codeblock></p>
        <p>If you only wanted the data under the first instance of <codeph>apps</codeph> in the XML
            document, you would add a position predicate as
            follows:<codeblock>/*/apps[1]/collections</codeblock></p>
        <p>To only process data from all <codeph>app</codeph> elements in the document where the
                <codeph>collections</codeph> element has a version attribute set to 3, add the
            version attribute and value as follows:
            <codeblock>/*/apps/collections[@version='3']</codeblock></p>
        <p>If you don't care what the value of the attribute is, you can use a wildcard for the
            attribute value, as
            follows:<codeblock>/root/apps/collections[@version='*']</codeblock></p>
