 <title>Access Permissions</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>whole file data format<indexterm>file access permissions</indexterm></indexterm>By
            default, when using the whole file data format, output files use the default access
            permissions defined in the destination system. Most destinations allow you to specify
            access permissions for output files. Amazon S3 does not allow it.</p>
        <p>You can enter an expression to define access permissions. Expressions should evaluate to
            a symbolic or numeric/octal representation of the permissions you want to use. For
            example, to make files read-only for all users, the symbolic representation is
                <codeph>-r--r--r--</codeph>. The numeric or octal representation is
                <codeph>0444</codeph>.</p>
        <p>To use the original source file permissions for each output file, you can use the
            following expression:<codeblock>${record:value('/fileInfo/permissions')}</codeblock></p>
        <p>This ensures, for example, that a source file with execute permission for only the file
            owner is written to the destination system with the exact same set of permissions. </p>
