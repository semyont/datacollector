 <title>Defining the Transfer Rate</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>whole file data format<indexterm>defining transfer rate</indexterm></indexterm>By
            default, the pipeline uses all available resources to transfer whole file data. Define a
            transfer rate to limit the resources that a whole file pipeline uses. For example, you
            might specify a transfer rate to enable running multiple whole file pipelines
            simultaneously or to reserve resources for other processing.</p>
        <p>Specify a transfer rate by configuring the <uicontrol>Rate per Second</uicontrol>
            property in the origin, in the whole file data format properties.</p>
        <p>The Rate per Second property is not used by default, allowing the pipeline to use all
            available resources. If you specify a transfer rate, the unit of measure is bytes per
            second by default. You can use a different unit of measure per second by using the unit
            of measure in an expression. </p>
        <p>For example, if you enter 1000, then the pipeline uses a transfer rate of 1000
            bytes/second. To specify a rate of 10 MB/second, you can use the following expression:
                <codeph>${10 * MB}</codeph>.</p>
