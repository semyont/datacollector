 <title>Including Checksums in Events</title>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>whole file<indexterm>including checksums in
            events</indexterm></indexterm>Destinations that generate events can include a checksum
            for each file. The Azure Data Lake Store destination does not generate events. </p>
        <p>When you enable checksum use, the destination includes the checksum and the checksum
            algorithm in the whole file event record. Whole file event records are generated each
            time the destination completes writing a whole file. </p>
        <p>You can use the following algorithms to generate checksums:<ul id="ul_lqh_35p_vx">
                <li>MD5</li>
                <li>SHA1</li>
                <li>SHA256</li>
                <li>SHA512</li>
                <li>MURMUR3_32</li>
                <li>MURMUR3_128</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>For details about event generation and event records for a specific destination, see the
            destination documentation. For generation information about the event framework, see
                <xref href="../Event_Handling/EventFramework-Overview.dita#concept_cph_5h4_lx"
