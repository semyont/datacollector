                    functions<indexterm>description</indexterm></indexterm>Use pipeline functions to
            determine information about a pipeline, such as the pipeline title or ID. The expression
            language provides the following pipeline functions: </p>
        <dl>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>pipeline:id()</dt>
                <dd>Returns the ID of the pipeline. The ID is a UUID automatically generated when
                    the pipeline is created and is used by <ph
                        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                    /> to identify the pipeline. The pipeline ID cannot be changed.</dd>
                <dd>Return type: String.</dd>
                <dd>For example, you can include the function in the directory template for the
                    Hadoop FS destination to include the pipeline ID in the output directory name.
                    The following expression creates output directories based on the pipeline ID and
                    timestamp of a
                    record:<codeblock>/outputfiles/${pipeline:id()}/${YYYY()}-${MM()}-${DD()}-${hh()}</codeblock></dd>
            </dlentry>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>pipeline:name()</dt>
                <dd>Like <codeph>pipeline:id</codeph>, this function returns the ID of the pipeline.
                    The ID is a UUID automatically generated when the pipeline is created and is
                    used by <ph

                    function is retained for backward compatibility. Use
                        <codeph>pipeline:id</codeph> for new development.</dd>

            </dlentry>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>pipeline:version()</dt>
                <dd>Returns the pipeline version when the pipeline has been published to <ph
