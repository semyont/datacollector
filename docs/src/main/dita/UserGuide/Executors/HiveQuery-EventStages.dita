 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>Hive Query executor<indexterm>event generating
            stages</indexterm></indexterm>Use the Hive Query executor in an event stream. The Hive
            Query executor is designed to run a set of Hive or Impala queries after receiving an
            event record. You can use the Hive Query executor with any event-generating stage where
            the logic suits your needs. </p>
        <p>When implementing the Drift Synchronization Solution for Hive with Impala, use the
            executor to run the Invalidate Metadata query after the Hive Metastore destination
            changes table structures and after the Hadoop FS destination writes files to Hive. </p>
