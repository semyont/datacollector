                    executor</indexterm></indexterm>The Hive Query executor can generate events that
            you can use in an event stream. </p>
        <p>The executor submits queries to Hive each time it receives an event record. When you
            enable event generation, the executor generates events each time it determines if the
            submitted query has completed. </p>
