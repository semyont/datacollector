 <title>Executors</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>executors<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>An executor stage triggers a
            task in an external system when it receives an event. Executors do not write or store
            events. </p>
        <p>Use executors as part of a dataflow trigger in an event stream to perform event-driven,
            pipeline-related tasks, such as moving a fully-written file when a destination closes
            it.</p>
        <p>For more information about the event framework, see <xref
                href="../Event_Handling/EventFramework-Overview.dita#concept_cph_5h4_lx"/>.</p>
        <p>You can use the following executors in a pipeline:<ul id="ul_htl_4dr_mx">
                <li><xref href="HDFSMetadata.dita#concept_wgj_slk_fx">HDFS File Metadata</xref> -
                    Changes file metadata upon receiving an event record.</li>
                <li><xref href="HiveQuery.dita#concept_kjw_llk_fx">Hive Query</xref> - Runs
                    user-defined Hive or Impala queries upon receiving an event record. </li>
                <li><xref href="JDBCQuery.dita#concept_j3r_gcv_sx">JDBC Query</xref> - Runs a
                    user-defined SQL query upon receiving an event record.</li>
                <li><xref href="MapReduce.dita#concept_bj2_zlk_fx">MapReduce</xref> - Starts the
                    specified MapReduce job upon receiving an event record. </li>
