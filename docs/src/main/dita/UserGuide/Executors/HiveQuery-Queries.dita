 <title>Hive and Impala Queries</title>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>Hive Query executor<indexterm>Hive and Impala
            queries</indexterm></indexterm>You can use the Hive Query executor to execute a set of
            Hive or Impala queries each time the executor receives an event record. </p>
        <p><ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/ph-HiveQuery"
            /></p>
        <p>When possible, avoid using Hive Query executor to run long-running queries. Also, when
            running multiple queries for an event record, you can configure the executor to skip the
            remaining queries if a query fails. By default, the executor continues to run the rest
            of the queries. </p>
        <p>You can use the fields and attributes in an event record in queries. For example, for
            event records generated when Hive Metastore creates or updates a table, you can use the
            table name in the event record to perform additional tasks.</p>
        <p>For a list of field names and descriptions in an event record, see the "Event Records"
            documentation for the event generating stage.</p>
