 <title>Cannot Connect to Database</title>
 <conbody>
        <p>When <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
            /> cannot connect to the database, an error message like the following displays - the
            exact message can vary depending on the driver:</p>
        <codeblock>JDBC_00 - Cannot connect to specified database: com.zaxxer.hikari.pool.PoolInitializationException:
Exception during pool initialization: The TCP/IP connection to the host 1.2.3.4, port 1234 has failed</codeblock>
        <p>In this case, verify that the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            machine can access the database machine on the relevant port. You can use tools such as
            ping and netcat (nc) for this purpose. For example, to verify that the host 1.2.3.4 is
            accessible:<codeblock>$ ping 1.2.3.4 
PING 1.2.3.4 (1.2.3.4): 56 data bytes 
64 bytes from 1.2.3.4: icmp_seq=0 ttl=57 time=12.063 ms 
64 bytes from 1.2.3.4: icmp_seq=1 ttl=57 time=11.356 ms 
64 bytes from 1.2.3.4: icmp_seq=2 ttl=57 time=11.626 ms 
^C

round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 11.356/11.682/12.063/0.291 ms</codeblock></p>
        <p>Then to verify that port 1234 can be
            reached:<codeblock>$ nc -v -z -w2 1.2.3.4 1234 
nc: connectx to 1.2.3.4 port 1234 (tcp) failed: Connection refused</codeblock></p>
        <p>If the host or port is not accessible, check the routing and firewall configuration.</p>
