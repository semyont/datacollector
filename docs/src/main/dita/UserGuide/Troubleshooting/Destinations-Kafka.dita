          <dt>Can the Kafka Producer create topics?</dt>
          <dd>The Kafka Producer can create a topic when all of the following are true:<ul
              id="ul_j4q_25y_3r">
              <li>You configure the Kafka Producer to write to a topic name that does not
                exist.</li>
              <li>At least one of the Kafka brokers defined for the Kafka Producer has the
                auto.create.topics.enable property enabled.</li>
              <li>The broker with the enabled property is up and available when the Kafka Producer
                looks for the topic.</li>
            </ul></dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>A pipeline that writes to Kafka keeps failing and restarting in an endless cycle.</dt>
          <dd>This can happen when the pipeline tries to write message to Kafka 0.8 that is longer
            than the Kafka maximum message size. </dd>
          <dd>Workaround: Reconfigure Kafka brokers to allow larger messages or ensure that incoming
            records are within the configured limit. <draft-comment author="Loretta">This replaces a
              release notes known limitation for SDC-2438.</draft-comment></dd>

        <dt>The Kafka Producer with Kerberos enabled cannot connect to the HDP 2.3 distribution of
          Kafka. </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>When enabling Kerberos, by default, HDP 2.3 sets the
              <uicontrol>security.inter.broker.protocol</uicontrol> Kafka broker configuration
            property to <codeph>PLAINTEXTSASL</codeph>, which is not supported.</p>
          <p>To correct the issue, set <uicontrol>security.inter.broker.protocol</uicontrol> to
              PLAINTEXT.<draft-comment author="Loretta">This is replacing a RN known limitation for
              SDC-1731</draft-comment></p>
