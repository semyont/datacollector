 <title>MySQL JDBC Driver and Time Values</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Due to a MySQL JDBC driver issue, the driver cannot return time values to the millisecond.
            Instead, the driver returns the values to the second.</p>
        <p>For example, if a column has a value of 20:12:50.581, the driver reads the value as
            20:12:50.000.</p>
 </conbody>
