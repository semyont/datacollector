    <dt>Why isn't my pipeline reading existing data from my Kafka topic? </dt>
    <dd>By default, the Kafka Consumer reads data written to the topic after you start the pipeline.
     Records already in the topic are ignored. </dd>
    <dd>To read the oldest unread data in a topic, add the <uicontrol>auto.offset.reset</uicontrol>
     Kafka Configuration property to the origin and set it to <uicontrol>smallest</uicontrol>.
      <note>If you already started the pipeline or ran a preview without this option, the offset has
      already been committed. To read the oldest unread data in a topic, set
       <uicontrol>auto.offset.reset</uicontrol> to <uicontrol>smallest</uicontrol> and then
      temporarily change the Consumer Group name to a different value. Run data preview. Then,
      change the Consumer Group back to the correct value and start the pipeline.</note></dd>

   <dlentry>
    <dt>How can I reset the offset for a Kafka Consumer?</dt>
    <dd>Since the offset for a Kafka Consumer is stored with the ZooKeeper for the Kafka cluster,
     you cannot reset the offset through the <ph
      conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>. For
     information about resetting an offset through Kafka, see the Apache Kafka documentation. </dd>

   <dlentry>
    <dt>The Kafka Consumer with Kerberos enabled cannot connect to an HDP 2.3 distribution of
     Kafka.</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>When enabling Kerberos, by default, HDP 2.3 sets the
       <uicontrol>security.inter.broker.protocol</uicontrol> Kafka broker configuration property to
       <codeph>PLAINTEXTSASL</codeph>, which is not supported.</p>
     <p>To correct the issue, set <uicontrol>security.inter.broker.protocol</uicontrol> to
       PLAINTEXT.<draft-comment author="Loretta">This is replacing a RN known limitation for
       SDC-1731</draft-comment></p>
