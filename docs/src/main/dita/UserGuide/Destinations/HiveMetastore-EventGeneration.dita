                    Metastore destination</indexterm></indexterm>The Hive Metastore destination can
            generate events that you can use in an event stream. When you enable event generation,
            the destination creates event records each time it updates the Hive metastore, including
            when it creates a table, adds columns, or creates a partition. <note>Updates to existing
                tables, columns and partitions are treated as creates since the destination does not
                change or delete existing structures. </note>Hive Metastore events can be used as
            follows: <ul id="ul_ohl_4pg_zx">
                <li>With the Hive Query executor to run Hive or Impala queries after updating the
                    Hive metastore.<p>For an example, see <xref
