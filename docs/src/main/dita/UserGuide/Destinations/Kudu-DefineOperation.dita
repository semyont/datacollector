 <title>Define the CRUD Operation</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>Kudu destination<indexterm>CRUD operation</indexterm></indexterm>The Kudu
            destination can insert, update, delete, or upsert data. The destination writes the
            records based on the CRUD operation defined in a CRUD operation header attribute or in
            operation-related stage properties. </p>
        <p>You define the CRUD operation in the following ways:</p>
        <dl>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>CRUD record header attribute</dt>
                <dd
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/RecordHeaderAtt"/>
                <dd>The attribute can contain one of the following numeric values:<ul
                        id="ul_smy_qf3_1y">
                        <li>1 for INSERT</li>
                        <li>2 for DELETE</li>
                        <li>3 for UPDATE</li>
                        <li>4 for UPSERT </li>
                    </ul></dd>
                <dd
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DefineRecordHeaderAtt"
                />
            </dlentry>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>Operation stage properties</dt>
                <dd
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DefaultOperation"/>
                <dd
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/UnsupportedOp"/>
                <dd>
                    <draft-comment author="Loretta">Alison: some old info I'm dropping, unless you
                        think we should add it to the conref. "Unsupported values include
                        non-numeric values, negative numeric values, or zero." – because it also
                        applies to any integer that's not supported? figured I'd rather skip the
                        whole thing since we list what's valid above? Also the fact that it's on the
                        Advanced tab –  I was thinking of logging a bug for that?</draft-comment>
                </dd>
            </dlentry>
        </dl>
