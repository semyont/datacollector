 <title>Row Key</title>
 <shortdesc>MapR DB uses a row key to uniquely identify each row in a JSON table. The row key is
        defined by the _id field of the JSON document stored in the row.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>row keys<indexterm>MapR DB JSON
                destination</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>MapR DB JSON destination<indexterm>row
                    keys</indexterm></indexterm>When you configure the MapR DB JSON destination, you
            define a field in the record to use as the row key. The field must contain a unique
            value. The destination writes the value of the specified field to the _id field in the
            JSON document. The destination retains the original field in the JSON document. </p>
        <p>For example, let's say you define the customer_ID field in the record as the row key.
            When the destination converts a record with a customer_ID of 034667 to a JSON document,
            the JSON document includes both an _id field and a customer_ID field with the value of
            034667. MapR DB uses the _id field with the value of 034667 in the JSON document as the
            row key in the JSON table. </p>
        <p>If the field defined as the row key doesn't exist in the record, the record is sent to the
            stage for error handling.</p>
