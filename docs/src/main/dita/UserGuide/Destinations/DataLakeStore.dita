                    Data Lake Store</indexterm></indexterm>The Azure Data Lake Store destination
            writes data to the Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store. You can use the Azure Data Lake
            Store destination in standalone and cluster batch pipelines at this time.</p>
        <p>Before you use the destination, you must perform some prerequisite tasks.</p>
        <p>When you configure the Azure Data Lake Store destination, you specify connection
            information such as the Client ID and fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the
            account. </p>
        <p>You can define a directory template and time basis to determine the output directories
            that the destination creates and the files where records are written. You can also
            define a file prefix and suffix, the data time zone, and properties that define when the
            destination closes a file. </p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can write records to the specified directory, use the defined Avro
            schema, and roll files based on record header attributes. For more information, see
                <xref href="../Pipeline_Design/RecordBasedWrites-overview.dita#concept_lmn_gdc_1w"
            />.</p>
