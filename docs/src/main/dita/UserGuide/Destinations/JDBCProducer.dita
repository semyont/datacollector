 <title>JDBC Producer</title>
 <shortdesc>The JDBC Producer destination uses a JDBC connection to write data to a database table.
        You can also use the JDBC Producer to write change capture data from a Microsoft SQL Server
        change log. </shortdesc>

                    Producer</indexterm></indexterm>When you configure JDBC Producer, you specify
            connection information, table name, and optionally define field mappings.</p>
        <p>By default, JDBC Producer writes data to the table based on the matching field names. You
            can override the default field mappings by defining specific mappings. </p>
        <p>You can configure the stage to rollback an entire batch if an error occurs while writing
            part of the batch. You can also configure custom properties that your driver requires. </p>

            health check query.</p>
