            in a local file system. </p>
        <p>When you configure a Local FS destination, <ph

        <p>You can write records to the specified directory, use the defined Avro schema, and roll
            files based on record header attributes. For more information, see <xref
                href="../Pipeline_Design/RecordBasedWrites-overview.dita#concept_lmn_gdc_1w"/>.</p>
        <p>The destination can generate events for an event stream. For more information about the
            event framework, see <xref
                href="../Event_Handling/EventFramework-Overview.dita#concept_cph_5h4_lx"/>.</p>
        <p>You can use Gzip, Bzip2, Snappy, LZ4, and other compression formats to write output
            files. </p>
