 <title>Read Preference - reusable content</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>MongoDB origin<indexterm>read preference</indexterm></indexterm>You can configure
   the read preference that the MongoDB origin uses. <draft-comment author="Loretta">All of the
    following P's are used by MongoDB origin and MongoDB Oplog origin > Read
    Preference.</draft-comment></p>
  <p id="Mongo-RP-1">The read preference determines how the origin reads data from different members
   of the MongoDB replica set. </p>
  <p id="Mongo-RP-2">You can use the following MongoDB read preferences:<ul id="ul_uh2_13t_ns">
    <li>Primary - Requires reading from the primary member.</li>
    <li>Primary Preferred - Prefers reading from the primary, but allows reads from a secondary
     member.</li>
    <li>Secondary - Requires reading from a secondary member.</li>
    <li>Secondary Preferred - Prefers reading from a secondary, but allows reads from a primary when
     necessary.</li>
    <li>Nearest - Reads from the member with the least network latency. </li>
   </ul>By default, the origin uses Secondary Preferred to avoid making unnecessary requests to the
   primary member.</p>
