 <title>Multithreaded Pipeline Overview</title>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>multithreaded pipelines<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>A
                <term>multithreaded pipeline</term> is a pipeline with an origin that supports
            parallel execution, enabling one pipeline to run in multiple threads. </p>
        <p>Multithreaded pipelines enable processing high volumes of data in a single pipeline on
            one <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
            />, thus taking full advantage of all available CPUs on the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            machine. When using multithreaded pipelines, make sure to allocate sufficient resources
            to the pipeline and <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
            />.</p>
        <p>At this time, you can use the HTTP Server origin to create a multithreaded pipeline. You
            can also use the Dev Data Generator development origin to test a multithreaded pipeline. </p>
        <p>A multithreaded pipeline honors the configured delivery guarantee for the pipeline, but
            does not guarantee the order in which batches of data are processed. </p>
