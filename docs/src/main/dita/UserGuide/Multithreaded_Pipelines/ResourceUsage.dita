 <title>Resource Usage</title>

                usage</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>resource usage<indexterm>multithreaded
                    pipelines</indexterm></indexterm>Since each pipeline runner performs all
            processing associated with the pipeline after the origin, each thread in a multithreaded
            pipeline requires roughly the same resources as the same pipeline running on a single
            thread. </p>
        <p>When working with multithreaded pipelines, review the resource usage of the pipeline and
            increase the Max Pipeline Memory pipeline property as needed. </p>
        <p>You should also monitor the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            resource usage and increase the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            Java heap size when appropriate. </p>
