        <draft-comment author="Loretta">Might want to migrate this information to a blog post or
            just send to Kirit. Not sure where it belongs. More info about the PushOrigin, etc., in
            the design doc.</draft-comment>

                <li>Pipeline offset storage - Offsets are no longer a simple string. To enable
                    storing the offset for multiple threads, the pipeline offset is now stored as a
                    map.</li>
