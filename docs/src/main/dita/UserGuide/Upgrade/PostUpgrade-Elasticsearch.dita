    <title>Update Elasticsearch Pipelines</title>
    <shortdesc><ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
        version 2.3.0.0 includes an enhanced Elasticsearch destination that uses the Elasticsearch
        HTTP API. To upgrade pipelines that use the Elasticsearch destination, you must verify that
        Java 8 is installed and review the value of the Default Operation property.</shortdesc>

            <note>The Elasticsearch version 5 stage library is compatible with all versions of
                Elasticsearch. Earlier stage library versions have been removed.</note>
