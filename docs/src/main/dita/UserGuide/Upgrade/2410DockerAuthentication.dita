 <title>Authentication for Docker Image</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>The Docker image for <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            version 2.4.1.0 now uses the form type of file-based authentication by default. As a
            result, you must use a <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            user account to log in to the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>.
            If you haven't set up custom user accounts, you can use the admin account shipped with
            the <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
            />. The default login is: <codeph>admin / admin</codeph>.</p>
        <p>Earlier versions of the Docker image used no authentication.</p>
