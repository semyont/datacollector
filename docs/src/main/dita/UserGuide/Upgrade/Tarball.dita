 <title>Upgrade an Installation from the Tarball</title>

                    tarball</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>upgrade<indexterm>core installation
                    from tarball</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>core install from

                    tarball<indexterm>upgrade</indexterm></indexterm>When you upgrade a full or core
            installation from the tarball, you configure the new version to use a new configuration
            directory outside of the base <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            runtime directory. You then configure the new version to use the same data, log, and
            resource directories as the previous version. As a result, the new version has access to
            the files created in the previous version.<note>If you installed additional drivers or
                developed custom stages, verify that those libraries are stored in a local directory
                external to the <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                /> runtime directory before you upgrade. That way, <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                /> can still use the libraries after the upgrade.</note></p>
        <p>To upgrade a full or core installation from the tarball, perform the following steps:</p>
