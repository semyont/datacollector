 <title>Upgrade an Installation from the RPM Package</title>
 <shortdesc>When you upgrade an installation from the RPM package, the new version uses the default
        configuration, data, log, and resource directories. If the previous version used the default
        directories, the new version has access to the files created in the previous
        version.</shortdesc>

                from RPM<indexterm>upgrade</indexterm></indexterm>If the previous version used
            customized values for the directory environment variables, you must make the same
            customizations in the new version so that the new version can access the same files.</p>
        <note>If you installed external libraries or developed custom stages, verify that those
            libraries are stored in a local directory external to the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            installation directory before you upgrade. That way, <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            can still use the libraries after the upgrade.</note>
        <p>To upgrade an installation from the RPM package, perform the following steps:</p>
