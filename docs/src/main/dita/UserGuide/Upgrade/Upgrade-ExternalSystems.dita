    <title>Working with Upgraded External Systems</title>
    <shortdesc>When an external system is upgraded to a new version, you can continue to use
        existing <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
        /> pipelines that connected to the previous version of the external system. You simply
        configure the pipelines to work with the upgraded system.</shortdesc>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>For example, let's say that you have pipelines that read from Apache Kafka version
                0.9. You upgrade Apache Kafka to version 0.10. You can continue to use the existing
                pipelines after you configure the Kafka stages to use the Kafka version 0.10 stage
                library.</p>
            <p>Or, let's say that you develop a pipeline to write to Cloudera CDH version 5.8
                distribution of Hadoop. Then you export and import the pipeline into a <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                /> that has the Cloudera CDH version 5.9 stage library installed. You can continue
                to use the imported pipeline after you configure the appropriate stages to use the
                Cloudera CDH version 5.9 stage library.</p>

                <info>For a tarball installation, you can use the Package Manager or the command

                        />.<p>For an RPM installation, you must use the command line to view or
                        install stage libraries, as described in <xref
