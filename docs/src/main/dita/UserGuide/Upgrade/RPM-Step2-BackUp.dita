    <title>Step 2. Back Up the Previous Version</title>
    <shortdesc>Before you install the new version, create a backup of the files in the previous
        version by copying and renaming the data, log, and resource directories. Youâ€™ll also need to
        create a backup of the environment configuration file,
            <codeph>$SDC_DIST/libexec/sdcd-env.sh</codeph>, so that the file is not overwritten when
        you install the new version. That way, you can continue to run the previous version if
        needed. </shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Copy and rename the following directories and files:<ul id="ul_grw_zch_1z">
                <li>Data directory defined in the SDC_DATA environment variable. Default is
                        <codeph>/var/lib/sdc</codeph>.</li>
                <li>Log directory defined in the SDC_LOG environment variable. Default is
                        <codeph>/var/log/sdc</codeph>.</li>
                <li>Resource directory defined in the SDC_RESOURCES environment variable. Default is
                        <codeph>/var/lib/sdc-resources</codeph>.</li>
                <li>Environment configuration file,
                    <codeph>$SDC_DIST/libexec/sdcd-env.sh</codeph>.</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>For example, if you are upgrading version 2.2.0.0, copy the Data Collector data directory
            and rename it as follows: <codeph>/var/lib/sdc2200</codeph>. Create a backup of the
            environment configuration file by renaming the file as follows:
                <codeph>sdcd-env-2200.sh</codeph>.</p>
