    <title>Step 2. Back Up the Previous Version</title>
    <shortdesc>Before you install the new version, create a backup of the files in the previous
        version by copying and renaming the configuration, data, log, and resource directories. That
        way, you can continue to run the previous version if needed.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Copy and rename the following directories:<ul id="ul_d4f_t1h_1z">
                <li>SDC_CONF - The <ph
                        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                    /> configuration directory.</li>
                <li>SDC_DATA - The <ph
                        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"

            </ul></p>
        <p>For example, if you are upgrading version 2.2.0.0, copy the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            configuration directory and rename it as follows: <codeph>/etc/sdc2200</codeph>.</p>
