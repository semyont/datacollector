 <title>Configure Pipeline Permissions</title>

                    2.4.0.0</indexterm></indexterm><ph

            version 2.4.0.0 is designed for multitenancy and enables you to share and grant
            permissions on pipelines. Permissions determine the access level that users and groups
            have on pipelines.</p>
        <p>In earlier versions of <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            without pipeline permissions, pipeline access is determined by roles. For example, any
            user with the Creator role could edit any pipeline. </p>
        <p>In version  2.4.0.0, roles are augmented with pipeline permissions. In addition to having
            the necessary role, users must also have the appropriate permissions to perform pipeline
            tasks. </p>
        <p>For example, to edit a pipeline in 2.4.0.0, a user with the Creator role must also have
            read and write permission on the pipeline. Without write permission, the user cannot
            edit the pipeline. Without read permission, the user cannot see the pipeline at all. It
            does not display in the list of available pipelines. </p>
        <p>With pipeline permissions enabled, all upgraded pipelines are initially visible only to
            users with the Admin role and the pipeline owner - the user who created the pipeline. </p>
        <p>To enable other users to work with pipelines, have an Admin user configure the
            appropriate permissions for each pipeline. </p>
        <p>To retain pre-2.4.0.0 behavior, you can disable pipeline permissions by setting the
                <uicontrol>pipeline.access.control.enabled property</uicontrol> to
                <uicontrol>false</uicontrol> in the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            configuration file.</p>
        <note type="tip">You can configure pipeline permissions when permissions are disabled. Then,
            you can enable the pipeline permissions property after pipeline permissions are properly
            configured. </note>

                href="../Configuration/RolesandPermissions.dita#concept_k1r_prc_yy"/>. For details
            about configuring pipeline permissions, see <xref
