 <title>Using Runtime Properties</title>
 <shortdesc>Runtime properties are properties that you define in a file local to the <ph
      conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> and call
    from within a pipeline. With runtime properties, you can define different sets of values for
    different <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
    />s.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>runtime properties<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>You can use runtime
      properties to define values for stage and pipeline properties. For example, you can define an
      error directory runtime property that points to different directories on a test machine and a
      production machine. Similarly, you might create test and production runtime properties for the
      origin and destination stages. </p>
    <p>You can use runtime properties for any pipeline property that allows the use of the
      expression language. You can, for example, use runtime properties to represent batch sizes and
      timeouts, directories, URI, and advanced properties. You cannot use runtime properties to
      represent fields or constants. </p>
  <p>To implement runtime properties, perform the following steps:<ol id="ol_m24_1bh_1s">
    <li>Define runtime properties. </li>
    <li>Use an expression in the pipeline to call a runtime property.</li>
   </ol></p>
