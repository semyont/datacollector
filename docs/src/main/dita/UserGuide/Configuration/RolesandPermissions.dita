            allows you to assign roles and pipeline permissions to users and groups.</p>
        <p>Roles, such as Creator or Manager, enable users to perform different <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            tasks. Each user needs at least one role to access <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>. </p>
        <p>Permissions determine read, write, and execute access to individual pipelines. Users
            generally need a combination of roles and permissions to perform pipeline-related tasks.
            For example, to edit a pipeline, you need the Creator role as well as read and write
            permission for the pipeline.</p>
        <p>Use groups to easily assign pipeline permissions to sets of users. When using LDAP
            authentication, you can also assign roles to LDAP groups. When a user belongs to a
            group, the user has the combination of the access assigned to the group and to the user
            individually.</p>
        <p>When necessary, you can transfer permissions from a user or group to another user or
            group. </p>
        <p>Note that users with the Admin role have full access to every pipeline. And the owner of
            a pipeline has full access to the pipeline. These users can also change who owns the
            pipeline.</p>
