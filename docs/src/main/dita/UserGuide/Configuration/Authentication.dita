 <title>User Authentication</title>
 <shortdesc><ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
        can authenticate user accounts based on LDAP or files. Best practice is to use LDAP if your
        organization has it. By default, <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> uses
        file-based authentication.</shortdesc>

            provides several roles that determine the actions that users can perform. The steps you
            use to assign roles to user accounts vary, based on whether you are using LDAP or
            file-based authentication.</p>
        <note>A production deployment of <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            should integrate with LDAP authentication. </note>
