 <title>Step 2. Call the Runtime Resource</title>
 <shortdesc>Use the <codeph>runtime:loadResource</codeph> function to call a runtime resource. You
  can use runtime resources to represent sensitive information in any stage or pipeline property
  that allows the use of the expression language. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>runtime resources<indexterm>calling from a pipeline</indexterm></indexterm>To call a
      runtime resource, use the following syntax: </p>
  <codeblock>${runtime:loadResource(&lt;file name>, &lt;restricted: true | false>)}</codeblock>
        <p>
            <note type="tip">To strip any leading or trailing white space characters from the file,
                add the <codeph>str:trim</codeph> function as
                follows:<codeblock>${str:trim(runtime:loadResource(&lt;file name>, &lt;restricted: true | false>)}</codeblock></note>
        </p>
  <p>For example, the following expression returns the contents of the JDBCpassword.txt file,
            stripping any leading or trailing white space characters. The file contains a password
            and is restricted so only the owner can read the
            file:<codeblock>${str:trim(runtime:loadResource("JDBCpassword.txt", true))}</codeblock></p>
