 <title>Custom Stage Libraries</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>custom stages<indexterm>libraries</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>user
                    libraries<indexterm>storing</indexterm></indexterm>If you develop custom stages,
            store the stage libraries in a local directory external to the Data Collector
            installation directory. Use an external directory to enable use of the custom stage
            libraries after Data Collector upgrades.</p>
        <p>We have tutorials for creating a custom origin, processor, and destination on our
            StreamSets tutorials page. To check them out, go to: <xref
                href="https://github.com/streamsets/tutorials" format="html" scope="external"/>. </p>
