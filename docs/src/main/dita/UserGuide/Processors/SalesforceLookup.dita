 <title>Salesforce Lookup</title>
 <shortdesc>The Salesforce Lookup processor performs lookups in a Salesforce object and passes the
        lookup values to fields. Use the Salesforce Lookup to enrich records with additional
        data.</shortdesc>

                    Lookup</indexterm></indexterm>For example, you can configure the processor to
            use an account_number field as the field to look up account name values in a Salesforce
            object, and pass the values to a new account_name output field.</p>
        <p>When you configure the Salesforce Lookup processor, you define connection information
            that the processor uses to connect to Salesforce. By default, the processor uses
            Salesforce API version 36.0. You can change the API version if needed.</p>
        <p>You configure the query to define the data to look up in Salesforce, and specify the
            output fields to write the lookup values to. You can optionally define a default value
            to use for fields with missing values.</p>
        <p>You can also configure the processor to locally cache the lookup values to improve
            performance.</p>
