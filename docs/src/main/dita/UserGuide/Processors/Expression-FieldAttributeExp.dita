 <title>Field Attribute Expressions</title>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>field attributes<indexterm>expressions</indexterm></indexterm>You can use
            expressions to add or modify field attributes for a record. For example, you can create
            a field attribute based on record data, then pass the record to a Stream Selector that
            routes data based on the attribute value. </p>
        <p>You can also use field attribute functions in a field expression to include field
            attribute values in the record. </p>
        <p>For more information about field attributes, see <xref
                href="../Pipeline_Design/FieldAttributes.dita#concept_xfm_wtp_1z"/>. For more
            information about field attribute functions, see <xref
                href="../Expression_Language/RecordFunctions.dita#concept_p1z_ggv_1r"/>.</p>
