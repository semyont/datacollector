 <title>Replacing Values with Nulls</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>Value Replacer processor<indexterm>replacing values with
                nulls</indexterm></indexterm>You can use Value Replacer to replace values in a field
            with null values. You can replace all values with nulls or you can replace values based
            on a condition. </p>
        <p>Use an expression to specify the condition that you want to use. For example, you can
            replace empty values with null values in a String field using the following
            condition:<codeblock>${str:length(record:value('/stringField')) == 0}</codeblock></p>
        <p>If you wanted to replace negative values with null values, you could use the following
            condition:<codeblock>${record:value('/intField') &lt; 0}</codeblock>Use the
                <uicontrol>Fields to Null</uicontrol> property to replace values with nulls. When
            you enter a condition, it applies to all listed fields. </p>
