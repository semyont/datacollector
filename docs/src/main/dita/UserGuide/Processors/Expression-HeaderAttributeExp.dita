 <title>Record Header Attribute Expressions</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>record header attributes<indexterm>expressions</indexterm></indexterm>You can use
            expressions to add or modify header attributes for a record. </p>
        <p>For example, you might use Expression Evaluator to set the sdc.operation.type attribute
            to enable writing to MongoDB.</p>
        <p>Some destinations can use record header attributes to perform record-based writes. For
            more information, see <xref
                href="../Pipeline_Design/RecordBasedWrites-overview.dita#concept_lmn_gdc_1w"/>. For general
            information about record header attributes, see <xref
