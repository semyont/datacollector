      time or one batch at a time. </p>
  <p>When you use a Jython Evaluator in a pipeline, the <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> passes a
      batch of data to the processor and converts the data to a scripting-friendly data structure
      for processing.</p>
        <p>The Jython Evaluator provides extensive sample code that you can use to develop your
            script. You can also call external Java code from the script.</p>
