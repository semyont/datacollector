                    Flattener</indexterm></indexterm>The Field Flattener flattens list and map
            fields. The processor can flatten the entire record to produce a record with no nested
            fields. Or it can flatten specific list or map fields.</p>
        <p>Use the Field Flattener when you have nested fields that you need to flatten. For
            example, the Drift Synchronization Solution for Hive cannot process records with nested
            fields, so you can use the Field Flattener to flatten records before passing them to the
            Hive Metadata processor. </p>
        <p>When you configure a Field Flattener, you configure whether to flatten the entire record
            or specific fields in the record. You also configure the name separator to use for
            flattened field names. </p>
