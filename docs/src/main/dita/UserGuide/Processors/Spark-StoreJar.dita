    <title>Installing the Application</title>
    <shortdesc>Install the Spark application JAR file as an external library for <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>. If
        your custom Spark application depends on external libraries other than the
        streamsets-datacollector-api, streamsets-datacollector-spark-api, and spark-core libraries,
        install those libraries in the same location as well. </shortdesc>

            <note type="tip">To include all dependent libraries used in your custom Spark
                application, you can use the Apache Maven Dependency Plugin. For more information
                about the Dependency Plugin, see <xref
                    href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/" format="html"

            <p>To install an external library for the Spark Evaluator, see <xref
                    href="../Configuration/ExternalLibs.dita#concept_pdv_qlw_ft"/>.</p>
            <p>
                <note>The Spark Evaluator processor is included in the Cloudera CDH stage libraries.
                    When you install external libraries for the processor, you must make them
                    accessible to the appropriate Cloudera CDH stage library.</note>
