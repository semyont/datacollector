 <title>OAuth 2 Authorization</title>
 <shortdesc>You can configure the HTTP Client processor to use the OAuth 2 protocol to connect to an
        HTTP service that uses basic, digest, or universal authentication, OAuth 2 client
        credentials, OAuth 2 username and password, or OAuth 2 JSON Web Tokens (JWT).</shortdesc>

                    2<indexterm>HTTP Client processor</indexterm></indexterm>The OAuth 2 protocol
            authorizes third-party access to HTTP service resources without sharing credentials. The
            HTTP Client processor uses credentials to request an access token from the service. The
            service returns the token to the processor, and then the processor includes the token in
            a header in each request to the resource URL.</p>
