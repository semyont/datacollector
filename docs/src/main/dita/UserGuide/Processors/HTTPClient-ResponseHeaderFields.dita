 <title>Response Header Fields</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>The HTTP Client processor can include response header field information in records. You can
            write the data to a record as follows:  <dl>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>Record header attributes</dt>
                    <dd>The processor can write data in response header fields to corresponding
                        record header attributes. </dd>
                    <dd>When writing to record header attributes, you define a prefix for the
                        attributes to avoid name conflicts. The processor then appends the response
                        header field name to the prefix. </dd>
                    <dd>For example, if you define "info-" as the prefix, then data in the
                        content-encoding response header field is written to the
                        "info-content-encoding" record header attribute.</dd>
                    <dd>For general information about record header attributes, see <xref
                            href="../Pipeline_Design/RecordHeaderAttributes.dita#concept_wn2_jcz_dz"
                        />.</dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>Record field</dt>
                    <dd>The processor can also write the response header fields to a field in the
                        record. The processor writes  the response header fields to the record field
                        as a map of key-value pairs where the key is the response header field name. </dd>
                    <dd>When writing to a field, you specify the field to use. If the field includes
                        data, the processor overwrites the data. If the field does not exist, the
                        processor creates the field. </dd>
                </dlentry>
            </dl></p>
