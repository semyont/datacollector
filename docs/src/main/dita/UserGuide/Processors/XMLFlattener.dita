                    Flattener</indexterm></indexterm>The XML Flattener processor flattens a
            well-formed XML document embedded in a string field and adds the flattened data to the
            record as additional fields or as a map in a single field.</p>
        <p>When you configure the XML Flattener, you specify the field that contains the XML data.
            You can specify a record delimiter to generate multiple records from the XML document.
            When specifying a record delimiter, use an XML element directly under the root element. </p>
        <p>You can configure whether the processor keeps all fields in the original record, or keeps
            just the flattened fields. </p>
        <p>You can also specify an output field. When you define an output field, the processor
            writes the flattened fields to the output field as a map. You can optionally configure
            the string used to separate entity names and attributes in the flattened field
            names.</p>
