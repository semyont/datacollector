                    Replacer</indexterm></indexterm>The Value Replacer replaces values in fields.
            You can use the Value Replacer to perform the following tasks:<ul id="ul_chv_2sk_3y">
                <li>Replace field values with nulls, optionally based on a condition</li>
                <li>Replace null values in specified fields with constants</li>
                <li>Replace field values with constants based on a condition</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>When you configure the processor, you specify the fields that you want to use, and the
            conditions and replacement values when appropriate. You can list multiple fields for
            each type of value replacement. And you can configure error handling for when a field
            does not exist. </p>
