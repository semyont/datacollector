                    Parser</indexterm></indexterm>The XML Parser parses a well-formed XML document
            embedded in a string field and passes the parsed data to an output field in the record. </p>
        <p>When you configure the XML Parser, you specify the field that contains the XML document
            and the target field for the parsed results. You can define a delimiter element to
            separate the document into multiple values. When no delimiter element is defined, XML
            Parser passes the entire document to the target field as a map.</p>
        <p>When defining the delimiter element, you can use an XML element or simplified XPath
            expression. <ph

            /></p>
        <p>When an XML document has more than one value, you can return the first value, all values
            as a list, or generate a record for each value in the document. </p>
        <p>When generating a record, the processor includes all other incoming fields in the
            generated record. When generating multiple records because of multiple values in the
            parsed field, the processor includes the other incoming fields for each generated
            record. </p>

                href="../Pipeline_Design/XMLDFormat.dita#concept_lty_42b_dy"/>.</p>
