 <title>Merging List-Map Data</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>As with List fields, when merging data in List-Map fields, the Field Zip processor merges each
            item in a list with the corresponding item in the other list. The processor merges the
            lists using the order of the lists, and returns a list of Map fields.</p>
        <p>The difference is, the lists in the Map fields include different pairs of information,
            rather than the matching pairs of information from List fields. </p>
        <p>For example, say you have a record with two List-Map fields, each with a single map in
            the list:<table frame="all" rowsep="1" colsep="1" id="table_bwh_2j1_hy">
                <tgroup cols="2">
                    <colspec colname="c2" colnum="1" colwidth="1.0*"/>
                    <colspec colname="c3" colnum="2" colwidth="1.0*"/>
                    <thead>
                        <row>
                            <entry><codeph>basics</codeph></entry>
                            <entry><codeph>additional</codeph></entry>
                        </row>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <row>
                            <entry>0<ul id="ul_sbt_l1f_3y">
                                    <li>id: 23</li>
                                    <li>color: 20005</li>
                                    <li>info: &lt;null></li>
                                </ul></entry>
                            <entry>0<ul id="ul_hbq_r1f_3y">
                                    <li>inventory: 80</li>
                                    <li>cost: $5.98</li>
                                </ul></entry>
                        </row>
                    </tbody>
                </tgroup>
            </table></p>
        <p>Say you configure the Field Zip processor to merge the Basics and Additional List-Map
            fields and to write the results to an All field. The Field Zip generates the following
            record:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/FieldZip-ListMap.png" id="image_nwj_g2f_3y" scale="60"/></p>
        <p>Notice how each map contains a different set of fields. When processing List fields,
            Field Zip returns the matching sets of fields. Also notice, the /Basics/Info field is
            not included because it has no corresponding item in the other List-Map field. </p>
        <p>If you configure the Field Zip processor to merge only the values, the processor returns
            the same data without the original field names, as follows: </p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/FieldZip-ListMap-NoFields.png" id="image_rx3_pvr_3y" scale="60"
            /></p>
