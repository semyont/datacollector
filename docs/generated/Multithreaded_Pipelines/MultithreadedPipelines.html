 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">A
                <dfn class="term">multithreaded pipeline</dfn> is a pipeline with an origin that supports
            parallel execution, enabling one pipeline to run in multiple threads. </p>

        <p class="p">Multithreaded pipelines enable processing high volumes of data in a single pipeline on
            one <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>, thus taking full advantage of all available CPUs on the <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            machine. When using multithreaded pipelines, make sure to allocate sufficient resources
            to the pipeline and <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>.</p>

        <p class="p">At this time, you can use the HTTP Server origin to create a multithreaded pipeline. You
            can also use the Dev Data Generator development origin to test a multithreaded pipeline. </p>

        <p class="p">A multithreaded pipeline honors the configured delivery guarantee for the pipeline, but
            does not guarantee the order in which batches of data are processed. </p>

 </div>

</div>
<div class="topic concept nested1" id="concept_xl3_ncd_py">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2">How It Works</h2>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">When you
            configure a multithreaded origin, you specify the amount of concurrency or number of
            threads that the origin should use. </p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">When you start the pipeline, the origin creates the
                        specified number of threads and <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> creates a matching number of <dfn class="term">pipeline runners</dfn> to perform
                        pipeline processing. The origin creates batches and passes each batch to a
                        pipeline runner. Each pipeline runner runs a <dfn class="term">sourceless pipeline
                              instance</dfn> - an instance of the pipeline that includes all of the
                        processors and destinations in the pipeline and performs all pipeline
                        processing after the origin.</span></p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph"> Each pipeline runner can process one batch at a time,
                        just like a pipeline that runs on a single thread. When the flow of data
                        slows, the pipeline runners wait idly until they are needed.</span></p>

        <p class="p">Multithreaded pipelines preserve the order of records within each batch, just like a
            single-threaded pipeline. But since batches are processed by different pipeline
            instances, the order that batches are written to destinations is not ensured.</p>

        <p class="p">For example, take the following multithreaded pipeline. The HTTP Server origin processes
            HTTP POST requests passed from HTTP clients. When you configure the origin, you specify
            the number of threads to use - in this case, the Max Concurrent Requests property:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_xl3_ncd_py__image_mxx_5sd_ry" src="../Graphics/Multithread-HTTPPipeline.png" height="263" width="470" /></p>

        <p class="p">With Max Concurrent Requests set to 5, when you start the pipeline <span class="ph">the origin creates five threads, and <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> creates five pipeline runners. Upon receiving data, the origin passes a
                        batch to each of the pipeline runners for processing. </span></p>

        <p class="p">Conceptually, the multithreaded pipeline looks like this:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_xl3_ncd_py__image_r5x_532_ry" src="../Graphics/Multithread-HTTPThreads.png" height="487" width="585" /></p>

        <p class="p">Each pipeline runner performs the processing associated with the rest of the pipeline.
            After a batch is written to pipeline destinations - in this case, Azure Data Lake Store
            1 and 2 - the pipeline runner becomes available for another batch of data. Each batch is
            processed and written as quickly as possible, independently from batches processed by
            other pipeline runners, so the write-order of the batches can differ from the
            read-order.</p>

        <p class="p">At any given moment, the five pipeline runners can each
                  process a batch, so this multithreaded pipeline processes up to five batches at a
                  time. When incoming data slows, the pipeline runners sit idle, available for use
                  as soon as the data flow increases.</p>

            These origins write incoming data directly to Kafka with no additional processing. They

<div class="topic concept nested2" id="concept_np1_pkz_ry">
 <h3 class="title topictitle3">Processor Caching</h3>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">Since multithreaded pipelines use multiple
            pipeline runners to run different instances of the pipeline, processor caching in a
            multithreaded pipeline differs from a pipeline that runs on a single thread.</p>

        <p class="p">When a processor caches record data, each instance of the processor keeps a separate
            cache. Each processor instance can only cache the data that passes through that
            particular pipeline runner. Be sure to consider this behavior when configuring
            multithreaded pipelines. </p>

        <p class="p">For example, if you configure a lookup processor to create a local cache, each instance
            of the lookup processor creates its own local cache. This should not be a problem since
            the cache is generally used to improve pipeline performance. </p>

        <p class="p">However, if you use the Record Deduplicator processor to remove duplicate records, the
            processor can only remove duplicate records from within a pipeline instance. The
            processor cannot locate records with duplicates in other pipeline instances. </p>

        <p class="p">The ability for a processor to share a cache across all pipeline instances is planned for
            future releases. </p>

 <h3 class="title topictitle3">Monitoring</h3>

 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">When you monitor a multithreaded pipeline, the
            pipeline and stage statistics that display are for the entire pipeline, aggregated
            across all pipeline runners.</p>

        <p class="p">You can view the number of pipeline runners associated with a pipeline and the number of
            idle runners that are available for use. The number of pipeline runners is based on the
            number of threads that you configured for the origin.</p>

        <p class="p">The pipeline runner information displays in the Runtime Statistics, as shown below:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_tdn_vwy_ry__image_bzb_yxf_sy" src="../Graphics/Multithreaded-Stats.png" height="385" width="320" /></p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Resource Usage</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">Since each pipeline runner performs all
            processing associated with the pipeline after the origin, each thread in a multithreaded
            pipeline requires roughly the same resources as the same pipeline running on a single
            thread. </p>

        <p class="p">When working with multithreaded pipelines, review the resource usage of the pipeline and
            increase the Max Pipeline Memory pipeline property as needed. </p>

        <p class="p">You should also monitor the <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            resource usage and increase the <span class="ph">Data

            Java heap size when appropriate. </p>
